        <div className="home-about">
          <p>
            After making a solid research for 7 months, we discovered that so
            many talents never fulfill their potential due to lack of guidance,
            motivation, empowerment and self belief and also we discovered that
            so many athletes retire without having any savings or investments
            which makes them poor despite quite big chunks of money passing
            through their hands during glory days. And so{" "}
            <strong>FAIR PLAY OFF-PITCH</strong> was created;
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              There was need to help the independent body in assessing and
              awarding the stakeholders basing on statistics annually.
            </li>
            <li>
              The need of other interested bodies to sensitize and prepare
              athletes for retirement
            </li>
            <li>
              The need to address and encourage everyone to promote humanity
              even further in this sector, both on and off pitch
            </li>
            <li>
              There was need to bridge to gap between talent and public, most
              especially in areas where sports is just in it's infancy
            </li>
            <li>
              There was also need for other interested bodies which where
              specifically responsible for nurturing, discovering, discovering
              and developing the young talents as well as fighting vices
